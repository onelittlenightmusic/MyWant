  title: MyWant API
  description: |
    MyWant is a Go library implementing functional chain programming patterns with channels.
    This API allows you to create, manage, and execute functional processing chains (called "Wants")
    through a RESTful interface.

    ## Core Concepts

    - **Want**: A processing unit in the chain with metadata, spec, status, and state
    - **Config**: Complete execution configuration containing an array of Wants
    - **Chain Execution**: Asynchronous execution of interconnected processing units
    - **Recipe System**: Reusable component templates with parameter substitution and CRUD management
    - **State History**: All `stateValue` fields in history entries are structured objects, not strings

    ## Recipe Management

    The API now supports full CRUD operations for recipe templates:
    - Create, read, update, and delete recipe configurations
    - Recipes serve as reusable templates for generating want configurations
    - Support parameter substitution and validation
    - **Example field**: Each recipe can include a top-level `example` field containing
      pre-configured want deployments for one-click recipe deployment from the frontend UI
