    title: Packet Collector
    description: 'Terminal sink that collects and aggregates all incoming packets
      from

      upstream processors. Implements packet collection with termination

      callbacks for final statistics and reporting.

      This is an alternative name for the sink want type, commonly used in

      queueing contexts to emphasize its data collection role.
