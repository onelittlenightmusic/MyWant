    title: Prime Number Sieve Sink
    description: 'Terminal sink that collects prime numbers identified by upstream
      sieve

      processing. Uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to filter numbers

      and collect only primes.

      This sink accumulates prime numbers and computes final statistics on

      the sieve output, useful for analyzing prime distribution and

      performance metrics.
