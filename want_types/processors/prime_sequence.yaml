    title: Prime Sequence Sieve
    description: 'Processor that filters numbers to identify primes using the Sieve
      of

      Eratosthenes algorithm. Receives a stream of numbers and outputs only

      the prime numbers, using previously found primes for efficient checking.

      This is a key component in prime-finding pipelines, connecting number

      generators to prime collectors/sinks.
