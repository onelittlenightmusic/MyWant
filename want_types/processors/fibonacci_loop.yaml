    title: Fibonacci Loop Processor
    description: 'Processor for feedback-loop based Fibonacci number generation. Receives

      seeds from fibonacci_source_loop and computes subsequent Fibonacci numbers

      using closure/closure pattern for recursive computation.

      Implements the iterative computation phase of the fibonacci_loop pattern

      where computation continues until the specified maximum count is reached.

    expectedBehavior: '1. Receives seed 0 at position 0

      2. Receives seed 1 at position 1

      3. Receives max_count signal (e.g., 15)

      4. Computes positions 2-14: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377

      5. Sends each computed value

      6. Sends end signal
