    description: 'Hotel reservation want type for travel planning. Schedules hotel
      stays

      with configurable hotel type (standard, luxury, budget). Handles check-in/check-out

      timing and supports agent-based booking for persistent state management.

      This independent want operates in parallel with other travel components

      (restaurant, buffet) and outputs scheduling conflicts to be resolved by

      the travel coordinator.
