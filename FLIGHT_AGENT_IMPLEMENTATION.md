# Flight Agent API Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the FlightAgent system with mock server integration for the MyWant project. The system demonstrates automatic flight rebooking when delays occur.

## Architecture

### Components Created

#### 1. **AgentFlightAPI** (`engine/cmd/types/agent_flight_api.go`)

A `DoAgent` that interacts with the mock flight server to create and manage flight reservations.

**Key Features:**
- Creates flight reservations via POST to mock server
- Cancels flights via DELETE to mock server
- Stores all reservation details in want state
- Tracks state changes for memory dump

**Methods:**
- `Exec(ctx, want)` - Creates flight reservation and stores state
- `CancelFlight(ctx, want)` - Cancels existing flight reservation

**State Keys:**
- `flight_id` - Unique identifier of the flight reservation
- `flight_status` - Current status (confirmed, details_changed, delayed_one_day, cancelled)
- `flight_number` - Flight number (e.g., AA123)
- `from` / `to` - Route information
- `departure_time` / `arrival_time` - Scheduled times
- `agent_result` - FlightSchedule with complete details

#### 2. **MonitorFlightAPI** (`engine/cmd/types/agent_monitor_flight_api.go`)

A `MonitorAgent` that polls the mock server to detect flight status changes.

**Key Features:**
- Polls GET endpoint every 10 seconds (configurable)
- Tracks status progression: confirmed → details_changed → delayed_one_day
- Records complete status change history with timestamps
- Stores all updates in want state for auditing

**Methods:**
- `Exec(ctx, want)` - Polls mock server and updates state
- `GetStatusChangeHistory()` - Returns all recorded status changes
- `WasStatusChanged()` - Checks if any status changes occurred

**Status Tracking:**
- `flight_status` - Current status from server
- `status_changed` - Boolean indicating if status changed in this poll
- `status_changed_at` - Timestamp of last change
- `status_history` - Array of all status transitions with times
- `status_change_history_count` - Total number of changes recorded

#### 3. **Enhanced FlightWant** (`engine/cmd/types/flight_types.go`)

Extended the existing FlightWant type to automatically detect and respond to flight delays.

**New Methods:**
- `shouldCancelAndRebook()` - Detects if flight status is "delayed_one_day"
- `cancelCurrentFlight()` - Executes cancellation and updates state
- `GetStateValue(key)` - Helper for safe state retrieval

**Execution Flow:**
1. Check if flight should be cancelled due to delay
2. If delayed, execute cancellation via DELETE API
3. Reset state for new booking attempt
4. Create new flight via POST API
5. All state changes tracked for memory dump

### Configuration Files

#### 1. **Capability Definition** (`capabilities/capability-flight.yaml`)
```yaml
capabilities:
  - name: flight_api_agency
    gives:
      - flight_api_reservation
```

#### 2. **Agent Registration** (`agents/agent-flight.yaml`)
```yaml
agents:
  - name: agent_flight_api
    type: do
    capabilities:
      - flight_api_agency
  - name: monitor_flight_api
    type: monitor
    capabilities:
      - flight_api_agency
```

#### 3. **Want Configuration** (`config/config-flight.yaml`)
```yaml
wants:
  - metadata:
      name: flight-booking
      type: flight
    spec:
      params:
        server_url: "http://localhost:8081"
        flight_number: "AA123"
        from: "New York"
        to: "Los Angeles"
      requires:
        - flight_api_reservation  # Triggers agent execution
```

## Execution Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialization**
   - FlightWant loads configuration with `requires: [flight_api_reservation]`
   - ChainBuilder sets up agent registry

2. **Agent Execution**
   - `ExecuteAgents()` finds agents that provide `flight_api_reservation` capability
   - AgentFlightAPI.Exec() is called synchronously (DO agent)
   - Creates flight via POST /api/flights
   - Stores reservation details in want state

3. **Monitoring (Async)**
   - MonitorFlightAPI.Exec() runs asynchronously (MONITOR agent)
   - Polls GET /api/flights/{id} every 10 seconds
   - Detects status changes and records them

4. **Status Progression** (Automatic on mock server)
   - T=0: Flight created as "confirmed"
   - T=20s: Status changes to "details_changed"
   - T=40s: Status changes to "delayed_one_day"

5. **Automatic Rebooking**
   - FlightWant.Exec() detects "delayed_one_day" status
   - Calls `cancelCurrentFlight()` which:
     - Executes DELETE /api/flights/{id}
     - Stores cancellation in state
     - Records previous flight ID for audit trail
   - Resets state for new booking
   - Creates new flight reservation

6. **State History Tracking**
   - Every state change recorded via `want.StoreState()`
   - State changes batched during execution cycle
   - Committed via `AggregateChanges()`
   - All history saved in memory dump on exit

## Memory Dump Output

The system produces a memory dump with complete state history showing:

```yaml
timestamp_execution_id: 20251017-145302
wants:
  - metadata:
      name: flight-booking
      type: flight
    state:
      flight_id: "original-flight-123"
      flight_status: "delayed_one_day"
      cancelled_flight_id: "original-flight-123"
      previous_flight_id: "original-flight-123"
      # ... more state
    history:
      state_history:
        - want_name: flight-booking
          timestamp: 2025-10-17T14:53:02Z
          state_value:
            flight_id: "original-flight-123"
            flight_status: "confirmed"
        - want_name: flight-booking
          timestamp: 2025-10-17T14:53:22Z
          state_value:
            flight_status: "details_changed"
        - want_name: flight-booking
          timestamp: 2025-10-17T14:53:42Z
          state_value:
            flight_status: "delayed_one_day"
        - want_name: flight-booking
          timestamp: 2025-10-17T14:53:44Z
          state_value:
            cancellation_successful: true
            cancelled_flight_id: "original-flight-123"
        - want_name: flight-booking
          timestamp: 2025-10-17T14:53:44Z
          state_value:
            flight_id: "new-flight-456"
            flight_status: "confirmed"
      agent_history:
        - agent_name: "agent_flight_api"
          agent_type: "do"
          start_time: 2025-10-17T14:53:01Z
          end_time: 2025-10-17T14:53:02Z
          status: "completed"
```

## Testing

### Unit Test

Run the MonitorFlightAPI test:
```bash
make test-monitor-flight-api
```

This demonstrates:
- Agent instantiation
- State management
- Status change detection

### Integration Test

Run the complete flow:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start mock server
make run-mock

# Terminal 2: Start flight booking demo
make run-flight

# Observe:
# - Flight creation (confirmed)
# - Status changes detected by monitor
# - Automatic cancellation when delayed
# - New flight created
# - Complete memory dump with state history
```

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. **State Tracking via StoreState()**
```go
want.StoreState("flight_status", newStatus)
want.StoreState("status_changed_at", time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339))
```
- All state changes properly recorded
- Automatic history tracking
- No direct state mutation

### 2. **Agent Capability Matching**
```yaml
requires:
  - flight_api_reservation  # Want requirement
```
Agent registry matches this with:
```yaml
capabilities:
  - flight_api_agency  # Provides flight_api_reservation
```

### 3. **Batched State Commits**
```go
want.BeginExecCycle()  // Start batching
// ... make multiple StoreState() calls
want.EndExecCycle()    // Commit all at once
want.AggregateChanges() // Record in history
```

### 4. **Error Resilience**
- Monitor agent runs asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Automatic retry on state detection

## Troubleshooting

### Mock server not responding
- Ensure mock server is running: `make run-mock`
- Check server is on port 8081: `curl http://localhost:8081/api/health`

### Agents not executing
- Verify agent YAML files are in `agents/` directory
- Check agent names match capability names
- Ensure `requires` field matches a capability

### State not persisting
- Verify `StoreState()` calls are within execution cycle
- Check `AggregateChanges()` is called after agent execution
- Confirm memory dump directory exists: `./memory/`
