- **Functions**:
  - Creates flight reservations via POST /api/flights
  - Cancels flights via DELETE /api/flights/{id}
  - Tracks all state changes for audit trail

#### 2. **MonitorFlightAPI** - Flight Status Monitor
- **Location**: `engine/cmd/types/agent_monitor_flight_api.go`
- **Type**: MonitorAgent (asynchronous)
- **Functions**:
  - Polls flight status every 10 seconds
  - Detects status transitions
  - Records complete change history

#### 3. **Enhanced FlightWant** - Intelligent Rebooking

## Performance Characteristics

```
Flight Creation:        ~100ms
Status Poll:           ~100ms
Delay Detection:       <10ms
Cancellation:          ~100ms
Rebooking:             ~100ms

Full Lifecycle:        ~50 seconds
  - Create (0-1s)
  - Wait for changes (2-40s)
  - Detect & Rebook (40-42s)
  - Report (42-50s)

Memory Footprint:      ~2MB per execution
State History:         5-10 entries per cycle
```

## Integration Examples

### With CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Start mock server
make run-mock &
MOCK_PID=$!

# Run test
make test-dynamic-travel-with-flight-api

# Cleanup
kill $MOCK_PID
```

### With Monitoring
```bash
# Watch flight status changes
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/flights | jq'

# Monitor memory dumps
watch -n 1 'ls -lh memory/*.yaml | tail -5'
```

### With Logging
```bash
# Capture output
make test-dynamic-travel-with-flight-api > test_output.log 2>&1

# Analyze results
grep "Status changed\|Cancelled\|Created" test_output.log
```

## Customization Options

### Change Flight Details
```yaml
# config/config-dynamic-travel-change.yaml
flight_number: "BA200"
from: "London"
to: "Paris"
```

### Change Server URL
```yaml
server_url: "http://your-api:8081"
```

### Change Flight Type
```yaml
flight_type: "first class"
```

### Change Monitoring Interval
```go
// agent_monitor_flight_api.go
PollInterval: 20 * time.Second  // Change from 10s
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Flight**: Handles one flight per want
2. **Fixed Poll Interval**: 10 seconds (configurable in code)
3. **No Auto-Retry**: Failed API calls not retried
4. **Synchronous Cancellation**: Uses temporary agent
5. **Single Recipe**: One recipe version at a time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Policies**: Custom rebooking strategies
2. **Multi-Flight Support**: Multiple flights per want
3. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failures
4. **Notifications**: Email/webhook on status changes
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track rebooking patterns
6. **Dynamic Intervals**: Adjust polling based on status

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "connection refused"
- **Solution**: Start mock server first: `make run-mock`

**Issue**: "No memory dump created"
- **Solution**: Check memory directory exists and permissions

**Issue**: Test takes too long
- **Solution**: Verify mock server is responsive

**Issue**: Agent not executing
- **Solution**: Check agent YAML registration files

See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive troubleshooting.
