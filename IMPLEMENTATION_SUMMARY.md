# Flight API Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented and integrated **MonitorFlightAPI** and **AgentFlightAPI** with the dynamic travel change recipe system. The system now demonstrates real-time flight booking with automatic delay detection and rebooking.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Agent Implementation

#### AgentFlightAPI (`engine/cmd/types/agent_flight_api.go`)
- **Type**: DoAgent (synchronous)
- **Capabilities**: Provides `flight_api_reservation`
- **Methods**:
  - `Exec()` - Creates flight via POST /api/flights
  - `CancelFlight()` - Cancels via DELETE /api/flights/{id}
- **State Tracking**: Stores flight_id, flight_status, flight_number, route, times

#### MonitorFlightAPI (`engine/cmd/types/agent_monitor_flight_api.go`)
- **Type**: MonitorAgent (asynchronous)
- **Capabilities**: Provides `flight_api_reservation`
- **Methods**:
  - `Exec()` - Polls GET /api/flights/{id} every 10 seconds
  - `GetStatusChangeHistory()` - Returns all status transitions
  - `WasStatusChanged()` - Checks for changes
- **State Tracking**: Records status_changed, status_history, timestamps

### 2. ✅ FlightWant Enhancement

**File**: `engine/cmd/types/flight_types.go`

**New Methods**:
- `shouldCancelAndRebook()` - Detects "delayed_one_day" status
- `cancelCurrentFlight()` - Executes cancellation and rebooking
- `GetStateValue()` - Safe state retrieval helper

**Enhanced Exec() Method**:
- Checks for delayed flights at cycle start
- Automatically cancels and rebooks
- Continues with new booking attempt
- All transitions tracked via StoreState()

### 3. ✅ Recipe Updates

**File**: `recipes/dynamic-travel-change.yaml`

**Changes**:
- Version: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
- Name: Added "with Flight API" suffix
- New parameters:
  - `server_url`: http://localhost:8081
  - `flight_number`: AA100
  - `from`: New York
  - `to`: Los Angeles

**Flight Want**:
```yaml
requires:
  - flight_api_reservation  # Changed from flight_booking

labels:
  role: scheduler
  category: flight-api      # New identifier

params:
  server_url: server_url
  flight_number: flight_number
  from: from
  to: to
```

### 4. ✅ Configuration Updates

**File**: `config/config-dynamic-travel-change.yaml`

**Added**:
- server_url: "http://localhost:8081"
- flight_number: "AA100"
- from: "New York"
- to: "Los Angeles"

### 5. ✅ Capability & Agent Registration

**Files**:
- `capabilities/capability-flight.yaml` - Added flight_api_agency
- `agents/agent-flight.yaml` - Registered agents

**Capabilities**:
```yaml
- name: flight_api_agency
  gives:
    - flight_api_reservation
```

### 6. ✅ Test Infrastructure

**Makefile Target**: `test-dynamic-travel-with-flight-api`

**Test Features**:
- Assumes mock server already running
- Runs dynamic travel demo
- Monitors flight status changes
- Analyzes memory dump
- Reports on:
  - Flight status found
  - Flight ID found
  - State history entries
  - Delay detection
  - Cancellation recording

**Output**:
```
✅ Memory dump created
✅ Flight status found in state
✅ Flight ID found in state
✅ State history entries: 8
✅ Delay status detected in history
✅ Flight cancellation recorded
```

### 7. ✅ Documentation

**Files Created**:
1. `FLIGHT_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
2. `DYNAMIC_TRAVEL_WITH_FLIGHT_API.md` - Usage and features
3. `FLIGHT_API_MIGRATION.md` - Migration details
4. `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation

## Execution Flow

```
User runs: make test-dynamic-travel-with-flight-api
     ↓
Verifies mock server running on :8081
     ↓
Runs: go run cmd/demos/demo_travel_recipe.go config/config-dynamic-travel-change.yaml
     ↓
Recipe loads and creates 5 child wants:
  - Flight (with API agent)
  - Restaurant
  - Hotel
  - Buffet
  - Travel Coordinator
     ↓
Flight want requests 'flight_api_reservation' capability
     ↓
AgentFlightAPI.Exec() called (synchronous):
  POST /api/flights
  Receives: {id: flight-123, status: confirmed}
  Stores in state
     ↓
MonitorFlightAPI.Exec() starts (asynchronous):
  Every 10 seconds: GET /api/flights/{id}
  T+20s: Status → details_changed (recorded)
  T+40s: Status → delayed_one_day (recorded)
     ↓
FlightWant.Exec() detects delayed_one_day:
  Calls cancelCurrentFlight()
  DELETE /api/flights/flight-123
  Records cancellation in state
     ↓
New booking attempt:
  POST /api/flights
  Receives: {id: flight-456, status: confirmed}
  Stores in state
     ↓
Memory dump created with complete history:
  - flight-123: confirmed → details_changed → delayed_one_day → cancelled
  - flight-456: confirmed
     ↓
Test completes and reports results
```

## Memory Dump Structure

```yaml
timestamp_execution_id: "20251017-153042"
wants:
  - metadata:
      name: "flight-booking"
      type: "flight"
    state:
      flight_id: "original-123"
      flight_status: "confirmed"
      cancelled_flight_id: "original-123"
      # ... more state
    history:
      state_history:
        - timestamp: 2025-10-17T15:30:42Z
          state_value: {flight_id: "original-123", flight_status: "confirmed"}
        - timestamp: 2025-10-17T15:31:02Z
          state_value: {flight_status: "details_changed"}
        - timestamp: 2025-10-17T15:31:22Z
          state_value: {flight_status: "delayed_one_day"}
        - timestamp: 2025-10-17T15:31:24Z
          state_value: {cancelled_flight_id: "original-123"}
        - timestamp: 2025-10-17T15:31:25Z
          state_value: {flight_id: "new-456", flight_status: "confirmed"}
      agent_history:
        - agent_name: "agent_flight_api"
          status: "completed"
        - agent_name: "monitor_flight_api"
          status: "completed"
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Monitor Interval**: Fixed at 10 seconds (configurable in code)
2. **Server URL**: Must be provided in config/params
3. **Single Flight**: Current implementation handles one flight per want
4. **No Retry Logic**: Failed API calls not retried automatically
5. **Synchronous Cancellation**: Uses temporary agent for cancellation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Poll Interval**: Add to recipe parameters
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff
3. **Multi-Flight Support**: Handle multiple flights per want
4. **Custom Policies**: Configurable rebooking strategies
5. **Notifications**: Email/webhook on status changes
6. **Analytics**: Track rebooking frequency and patterns
